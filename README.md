# Dwarf Engine

**An open-source and cross-platform scene editor built in C++**<br>
Version `0.1` â€” _First public release_

Dwarf Engine is a native, real-time 3D editor designed to help you visualize and edit scenes with minimal overhead.<br>
Easily use your own native shaders, or customize the source code to create your own graphics features.<br>
It supports hot-reloaded assets, custom materials, a forward renderer, and a growing set of editor tools.

This project is developed and maintained by [@CtrlAltNino](https://github.com/CtrlAltNino), and documented in depth on [the development blog](https://blog.ctrlaltnino.com).
