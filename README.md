# Simple 3D Engine

### Description

Simple 3D Engine, or in short S3DE, is a WIP Engine written in C++ and using OpenGL (How original). It's main purpose is to be a robust foundation to create 3D scenes, the use of common realtime render features (shadows, culling, etc...), rapid implementation of Effects (Custom Post Processing effects, Particles, etc...), and research of new graphics features.

### Planned Features

- <u>General Engine Features:</u>
  - Saving and loading of S3DE projects
  - GUI that reflects the state of the scene
  - Improved management of models
  - Runtime import of ressources (models, textures, shaders)
  - Animation System
  - Multi Threading
  - Framerate limiting
  - VSync

- <u>Basic Rendering Features:</u>
  - Full implementation of Forward, Deffered, and Forward+ Rendering
  - Transparency Sorting
  - Modularity that allows to quickly integrate new Post Processing Effects
  - Fog System
  - Motion Vectors
  - Depth Buffer

- <u>Advanced Graphical Features:</u>
  - Particle Effect System
  - Anti Aliasing Implementations (MSAA, FXAA, TAA)
  - Shadow Mapping
  - Light Mapping
  - Reflection Probes
  - Depth of Field
  - Motion Blur (Camera based and Object based)
  - Chromatic Aberration
  - Screen Space Reflections
  - Subsurface Scattering
  - More Advanced Lighting Models
